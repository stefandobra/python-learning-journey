# 🧠 Python Programming Journey – mooc.fi 2025

This repository documents my progress through the [mooc.fi Python 2025 course](https://programming-22.mooc.fi/), with a targeted focus on mastering Python for **AI automation and engineering roles**.

---

## 🎯 Career Goal

To become a highly skilled AI automation developer, capable of building tools, bots, and scalable systems — with strong fundamentals in Python, data handling, and object-oriented design.

GitHub is a live mirror of my discipline, learning, and technical progression.

## ✅ Why Stop at Part 9?

- Parts 1–9 include **everything needed** for:
  - Automation scripts
  - File/data processing
  - Reusable class-based tools
  - Real-world projects and job readiness
- Parts 10–14 (advanced) focus on recursion, game dev, and niche topics — optional later

## 🧪 Mini Projects & Real-World Demos

These are inspired by course content, used to apply knowledge to real use cases:

- [ ] Booking System Simulator
- [ ] Email Cleaner Utility
- [ ] File-Based Task Logger
- [ ] API Wrapper Template (post-Part 6)
- [ ] Voice Assistant Prototype (future)
